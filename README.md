The least practical way to check the current date

## Overview
This little website gives you the current date, in your local time... relative to a random month and year.<br>
It does this by taking the difference between the 1st of the random month and the current day, then adding the difference between the relevant years.<br>
For example, if you were to open the site on January 1st, 2024, then you might see "Today is January 366, 2023", since 365 days have passed since January 1, 2023.<br>
Leap years are taken into account.
